Great! This is how it works.

1. Send me a quick email to let me know you're interested.
2. We'll start with a 1 - 2 hour meeting. You'll tell me about your technologies, problems, and ideas. I'll tell you how I can solve your problems and make your ideas become reality.
3. If we choose to pursue a business relationship then I'll send over a contract. The contract will define how the relationship will work including rates, payments, timelines, deliverables, and anything that I'll need from you to begin work.

Shoot me an email and let's do it!
