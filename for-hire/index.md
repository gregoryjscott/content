Technology moves so fast. Change is exciting, but it's also a little scary. We can't stop it, so our only choice is to embrace it. Fortunately, it turns out that change isn't so scary if you prepare for it. In fact, it can even be fun!

**I've helped schools, governments, and businesses** of all kinds build systems that work _and_ change over time. Technology systems are either improving or dying - that's how technology evolves.

In this world filled with technology, chances are good that you're dealing with technology problems at your place of work. Perhaps **I can help you**.

# Think I might be able to help you?

Great! This is how it works.

1. Send me a quick email to let me know you're interested.
2. We'll start with a 1 - 2 hour meeting. You'll tell me about your technologies, problems, and ideas. I'll tell you how I can solve your problems and make your ideas become reality.
2. If we choose to pursue a business relationship, then I'll send over a contract. The contract will define how the relationship will work, including everything that I'll need from you to get started.
3. After the contract is signed we'll start making your technology troubles go away!

I love to teach, learn, and build technology, and I'm pretty good at it. Please let me know if I can put these skills to use for you. Thank you for your consideration.
